# Smart-Calendar

## Introduction

The inspiration for our smart calendar comes from dealing with time zone craziness and jumbled up schedules for international students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite efforts to make studying fairer for domestic and international students alike, the domestic timezone still takes precedence. As a group of international students, we have identified a number of pains that we aim to tackle with our product. 

Pains:
 - Convoluted deadlines & misleading dates
 - Confusing timezones + Daylight saving 
 - Hard to socialize with classmates, hard to find study-mates. (Exacerbated by midnight dicussion sections)

To deal with these problems, we are introducing the following features:
 - Flexible timezone changes for the calendar.
 - Intelligent deadline management, day-shift and midnight warnings. 
 - If willing, the system will introduce students with similar schedules as study-mates.
